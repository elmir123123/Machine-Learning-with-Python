Exploring Machine Learning Methods

Apprentice Chef, Inc. - a company that is offers a wide selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door.

I was tasked with analyzing data that represented the customer order preferences as well as their demographic data. Our objective was to build a predictive model to better understand which factors have the biggest effect on revenue. 


Processing and Model Development techniques used:

- Feature Engineering 
- Dummy Variable Encoding
- Training and Test Set Building
- Model Instantiation, Fitting, Predicting, and Scoring
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Automated Hyperparameter Selection


Supervised Techniques used:

- OLS Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- CART Models

In the final report I have provided two business insights and one actionable insight for the company, based on its customers' behaviour. Reasoning my decision with graphs and values derived from OLS regression.
